WP-Sponsors gives your sponsors or partners a separate home where you can add a link and a logo.

== Description ==

WP-Sponsors gives your sponsors or partners a separate home where you can add a link and a logo.

Ever had to add a bunch of images with links on them for your event/company partners? With Sponsors, you won't have to use a text widget for that anymore. The companies and people that support you, your company or your event now get a separate place where you can add a link and an image for each of them. Then you add the Sponsors widget to the sidebar of your choosing and the linked images will show up there.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-sponsors` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add your sponsors under the sponsors section with links and logo's
4. Add the widget to your sidebar


== Screenshots ==
1. After you activate the plugin, a new content type will become available on the your WordPress admin panel. Here you can add a link, a description and an image for each Sponsor.
2. Add the widget to one or more sidebars and the images of your sponsors will show up there. Choose from which category you want to display sponsors (or select all), to show or hide images and the description
